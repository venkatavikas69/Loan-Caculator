# Loan-Caculator

A Simple Car Loan Payment Calculator
Letâ€™s combine a few of the concepts that you have learned so far: conditionals, Boolean expressions, and arithmethic expressions.

In this project, you will write a program that will calculate the monthly car payment a user should expect to make after taking out a car loan. The program will include the following:

--> Car loan amount
--> Interest rate of the loan
--> Length of the loan (in years)
--> Down payment
